# Idle_Frost
This is a small Android survival game with game mechanics focused on ecology.
Many survival games are centered around the character actually trying to survive, this game makes surviving pretty easy, but with every wood you chop down, the environmental values change and make surviving less easy in the long run, as natural desaster may occure more oftenyl as you change the forest.
Basically an Idle/Survival/Serious game.
Also, this game is based on Weird Arctic Animal Game. That was the quick and dirty version, this is becoming the actualy game.
